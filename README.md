# The excercise from Data Science in VS Code tutorial

<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial>

This tutorial demonstrates using Visual Studio Code and the Microsoft Python extension with common data science libraries to explore a basic data science scenario. Specifically, using passenger data from the Titanic, you will learn how to set up a data science environment, import and clean data, create a machine learning model for predicting survival on the Titanic, and evaluate the accuracy of the generated model.

## Prerequisites

The following installations are required for the completion of this tutorial. Make sure to install them if you haven't already.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* [The Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Jupyter extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) from the Visual Studio Marketplace. By default, the Python extension installs the Jupyter extension for you. For more details on installing extensions, see [Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace). Both extensions are published by Microsoft.

* [Miniconda with Python 3.9](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Note: If you already have the full Anaconda distribution installed, you don't need to install Miniconda. Alternatively, if you'd prefer not to use Anaconda or Miniconda, you can create a Python virtual environment and install the packages needed for the tutorial using pip. If you go this route, you will need to install the following packages: pandas, jupyter, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras, and tensorflow.
